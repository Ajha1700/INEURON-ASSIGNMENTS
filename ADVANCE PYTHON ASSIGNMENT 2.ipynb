    "\n",
    "classes and modules are both ways to organize code, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. It allows you to organize related code into\n",
    "a single file that can be imported and used in other Python programs. Modules can define functions, classes, and \n",
    "variables that can be used in other programs by importing them using the import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that \n",
    "describe the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. Classes are used to encapsulate data and \n",
    "behavior into a single unit, making it easier to manage and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may use classes within a module. For example, you may define a class in a module to encapsulate \n",
