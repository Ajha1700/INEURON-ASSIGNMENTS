    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is the way they store and retrieve values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a built-in data structure in Python that represents an ordered collection of elements.\n",
    "Each element is assigned a unique index based on its position in the list. Lists are mutable, \n",
    "which means that their elements can be changed, added, or removed. \n",
    "For example, you can create a list of numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "A dictionary, on the other hand, is another built-in data structure in Python that represents an unordered collection\n",
    "of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary is unique and is used to identify the corresponding value.\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, and their elements can be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "For example, you can create a dictionary of phone numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "8. How do you \"pretty print\" dictionary values using which module and function?\n",
