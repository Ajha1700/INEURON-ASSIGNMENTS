    "The main advantage of using dynamic_rnn() to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) is that it can handle variable-length \n",

    "\n",
    "Flexible sequence length: dynamic_rnn() can handle sequences with variable lengths, which is not possible with static_rnn().\n",

    "    compared to static_rnn(), which needs to allocate memory for the entire sequence upfront.\n",

    "Faster computation: dynamic_rnn() uses a while loop to iterate over the sequence, which can be faster than the unrolling \n",
