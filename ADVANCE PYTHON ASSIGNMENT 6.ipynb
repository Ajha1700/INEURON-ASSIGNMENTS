    "Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",

    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing is a programming construct that allows the handling of unexpected or exceptional situations that\n",
    "may arise during program execution. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Exception processing is widely used to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.\n",
    "    For example, if a file that a program is trying to read does not exist, an exception can be raised and handled to provide \n",
    "    a meaningful error message to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Validation: Exception processing can be used to validate user input and ensure that it meets certain requirements.\n",
    "    For instance, if a program expects a numeric input but receives a string input, it can raise an exception to handle\n",
    "    the error and prompt the user to provide valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: Exception processing can also be used to manage system resources such as memory, files, and network\n",
    "    connections. When an exception is raised during resource allocation or deallocation, it can be handled to ensure that\n",
    "    the resources are released properly and the program does not crash or hang."

    "Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    " If Exceptions are not handled flow of program will be broken during the run time which might lead to a abnormal \n",
    "    termination of the program. Inshort inability of program to handle exceptions will result in crashing of program."
