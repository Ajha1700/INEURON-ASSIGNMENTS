    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), corpora refer to large collections of text or speech data that are used to train\n",
    "and evaluate machine learning models for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, information extraction, machine\n",
    "translation, sentiment analysis, and language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP corpora can include various types of data, such as news articles, web pages, social media posts, academic papers,\n",
    "and speech recordings. They are often annotated with linguistic information, such as part-of-speech tags, named entities,\n",

    "4.How to generate n-grams from text?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate n-grams from text, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing: Before generating n-grams, you may need to perform some preprocessing steps, such as lowercasing, \n",
    "    removing punctuation, and tokenizing the text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating n-grams: Once you have preprocessed the text, you can generate n-grams by sliding a window of size n over\n",
    "    the tokenized text and extracting the n consecutive tokens in each window. For example, to generate bigrams from \n",
    "    the following sentence: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", you can slide a window of size 2 over the\n",
    "        tokenized words: [\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", \"over\", \"the\", \"lazy\", \"dog\"]. The resulting bigrams\n",
    "            would be: [(\"The\", \"quick\"), (\"quick\", \"brown\"), (\"brown\", \"fox\"), (\"fox\", \"jumps\"), (\"jumps\", \"over\"), \n",
    "                       (\"over\", \"the\"), (\"the\", \"lazy\"), (\"lazy\", \"dog\")].\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling boundary cases: Depending on the size of n and the length of the text, you may need to handle boundary \n",
    "    cases where the window cannot slide over the entire text. For example, if you want to generate trigrams from the \n",
    "    sentence \"The quick brown fox\", you will only get one trigram: [(\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\")], since there are no more \n",
    "        words to form a trigram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing n-grams: Once you have generated the n-grams, you can store them in a suitable data structure, such as a list,\n",
    "    a dictionary, or a database, depending on your specific application and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, generating n-grams from text is a relatively straightforward process, and it is a useful technique for analyzing\n",
    "and modeling text data in NLP applications.\n",
