    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is a class in object-oriented programming that is designed to be inherited from by other classes.\n",
    "It is declared as abstract, which means that it cannot be instantiated on its own, and it contains one or more abstract\n",
    "methods that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a common set of properties and methods that can be shared among \n",
    "its subclasses. This allows for the creation of more specialized classes that can inherit and extend the functionality\n",
    "of the superclass while also adding their own unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract superclasses are often used to define interfaces for classes that have common characteristics but different\n",
    "implementations. By defining a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses, an abstract superclass\n",
    "can ensure that these classes conform to a specific interface or behavior.\n",
    "\n",

    "defining a set of methods and properties that they can inherit and extend.\n"

    "\n",
    "Name resolution: When a name is referenced within a class method, the Python interpreter searches for the name in the local\n",
