    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are advantageous to have in our programs in Python (and in programming in general) for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allows us to write a block of code that can be reused in multiple places throughout our program. \n",
    "             This means you can avoid duplicating code, making your program more concise and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allows us to abstract away complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
    "    This can make our code more readable and easier to understand, as well as easier to test and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions can help us to organize our code into modular, self-contained pieces that can be developed and tested\n",
    "    independently of the rest of the program. This can make our code more modular and easier to maintain and extend over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code clarity: Functions can also make our code easier to read and understand.\n",
    "    By giving descriptive names to our functions, we can make the intent of our code more clear,\n",
    "    which can help us and others understand the purpose and function of our code more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are an essential building block of Python programming, enabling us to write more concise, modular, and reusable code."

    "2. When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called?\n",
    "    \n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the code in a function runs when the function is called, not when it is specified.\n",
    "When we define a function, we are essentially creating a block of code that will be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "The function definition itself does not execute the code it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(\"Before function call\")\n",
    "print_hello()\n",
    "print(\"After function call\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the print_hello function is defined, but the code inside the function is not executed until the function\n",
    "is called. When the program runs, it will print \"Before function call\" first, \n",
    "then call the print_hello function, which will print \"Hello, World!\". Finally, it will print \"After function call\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So,the code in a function runs when the function is called, and not when it is defined.\n",

    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a function in Python, you use the def statement. The def statement is followed by the name of the function, \n",
    "parentheses (), and a colon :. The body of the function is then indented below the def statement.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, we define a function called greet that takes one argument name. \n",
    "The body of the function is a single statement that prints a greeting message that includes the name argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call the greet function, we would simply use its name followed by parentheses and the argument\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout a program.\n",
    "It is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for any arguments, and a colon. \n",
    "The body of the function is then indented below the def statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a function call is the process of invoking or executing a function. \n",
    "To call a function in Python, we simply use the name of the function followed by parentheses with any necessary \n",
    "arguments inside the parentheses. When a function is called, the code inside the function body is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "greet(\"Aman\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, greet is a function that takes one argument name and prints a greeting message that includes the name argument. \n",
    "The function is defined using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of the code is a function call, where we pass the argument \"Aman\" to the greet function.\n",
    "This causes the code inside the greet function to execute, printing the message \"Hello, Aman!\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, while a function call is the process of executing\n",

    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is only one global scope per program. \n",
    "This means that any variable that is defined outside of a function can be accessed from any part of the program.\n",
    "Once a variable is defined in the global scope, it is available throughout the program, including inside any functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, \n",
    "local scopes are created every time a function is called. This means that any variable that is defined \n",
    "inside a function is only accessible within that function.\n",
    "When the function completes its execution, the local scope is destroyed and any variables defined within that scope\n",
    "are also destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its important to note that while there can be multiple local scopes in a Python program (one for each function call),\n",

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",

    "When a function call returns, the local scope that was created for that function is destroyed. \n",
    "Any variables that were defined within the local scope are also destroyed and are no longer accessible.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the function is called with arguments 2 and 3, a local scope is created, and the variables a, b, and \n",
    "total are defined within that scope. The sum of a and b is calculated and stored in total, and then total is returned\n",
    "by the function. Finally, the local scope is destroyed and the variables a, b, and total are no longer accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned value of total is assigned to the variable result, which is then printed to the console. This output will be 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a return value is the value that a function sends back to the calling code after it completes its execution.\n",
    "A return value can be any Python object, such as a number, string, list, or even another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a return value in a function, you use the return statement followed by the value or expression that \n",

    "    return x * x\n",

    "In this function, the return statement sends back the value of x * x to the calling code after it completes its execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression. \n",
    "In Python, we can use a function call as an expression in any part of your code where an expression is allowed. \n",
    "This means that you can call a function and use its return value in the same line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "result = square(3) + 5\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "In this code, the square function is called with an argument of 3, which returns the value 9. The returned value \n",
    "is then added to 5 to produce the final value of 14, which is stored in the variable result.\n",
    "The value of result is then printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "so, a return value in Python is the value that a function sends back to the calling code after it completes its execution.\n",

    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",

    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "ANSWER\n",

    "In Python, to make a function variable refer to a global variable, you can use the global keyword inside the function.\n",

    "In this example, we define a global variable x with a value of 10. We then define a function called print_x that prints \n",

    "rather than a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
